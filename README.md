### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs effectively prepared me to complete the assignment, particularly in understanding the HTML skeleton and CSS padding/margin. However, I felt less prepared when it came to implementing Flexbox and media queries.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

  If I had more time, I would have approached the project differently in several ways. Firstly, I would use a Minimum Viable Product(MVP) manner of going back and forth with html and css rather then completing html alone and then moving onto css. I would also add a GIF for the banner to make it more dynamic and engaging. Secondly, I would incorporate an interactive GPS/Google Maps section for the locations provided on the website, enhancing the user experience with real-time navigation features. 
  
* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Setting up the food guide, navigation bar, and banner went well, and I was pleased with how smoothly these elements were integrated into the project. However, I faced challenges with the responsive design. I observed a peer's effective use of flexbox to enhance responsiveness, which allowed their layout to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Next time, I plan to incorporate similar flexbox techniques to improve the adaptability and aesthetics of my design across various devices. Additionally, I aim to refine my CSS structure to ensure a more streamlined and visually appealing responsive experience.
